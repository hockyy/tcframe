**tcframe** is a C++ framework for generating test cases of competitive programming problems. This framework helps problem writers prepare test cases in a structured manner and ensures that the generated test cases are valid according to the specified constraints.

Consult the complete documentation at https://tcframe.toki.id.

Example high-level usage:

1. Specify input/output variables.

    ```cpp
    int A, B;
    int sum;
    ```

1. Specify input/output formats, using a rich set of format macros.

    ```cpp
    void InputFormat() {
        LINE(A, B); // A line containing space-separated A and B
    }
    void OutputFormat() {
        LINE(sum);
    }
    ```

1. Specify the grading configuration.

    ```cpp
    void GradingConfig() {
        TimeLimit(1);
        MemoryLimit(64);
    }
    ```

1. Specify the constraints. Subtasks are supported.

    ```cpp
    void Constraints() {
        CONS(1 <= A && A <= 1000);
        CONS(1 <= B && B <= 1000);
    }
    ```

1. Specify the sample test cases.

    ```cpp
    void SampleTestCase1() {
        Input({
            "2 8"
        });
        Output({
            "10"
        });
    }
    void SampleTestCase2() {
        Input({
            "42 100"
        });
        Output({
            "142"
        });
    }
    ```

1. Specify the official test cases. Simple random number generator is available.

    ```cpp
    void TestCases() {
        CASE(A = 1, B = 1);
        CASE(A = 77, B = 99);
        CASE(A = rnd.nextInt(1, 1000), B = rnd.nextInt(1, 1000));
    }
    ```

1. Write and compile the official solution to this problem, using any programming language you wish. Of course, it is the infamous A+B problem.

    ```cpp
    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;

    int main() {
        int A, B;
        cin >> A >> B;
        cout << (A + B) << endl;
    }
    ```

1. Run the generator. Actual test cases (`.in` and `.out` files) will be generated. Profit!

1. If you ever specified an invalid test case, such as `CASE(A = 0, B = 1)`, you will get a nice error message:

	```
      sum_4: FAILED
        Description: A = 0, B = 1
        Reasons:
        * Does not satisfy constraints, on:
          - 1 <= A && A <= 1000
	```

## Features

**tcframe** supports:

- Batch and interactive problems.
- ICPC-style problems and IOI-style problems with subtasks and points.
- Multiple test cases per file.
- Local grading against the generated test cases, with time and memory limits.
- Simple random number generation helper.

## Requirements

**tcframe** requires:

- Linux/macOS. Windows is not supported.
- GCC â‰¥ 4.8. **tcframe** relies heavily on C++11 features.

## Motivations

**Why do we need test case generators?**

- Writing test cases manually is error-prone and time-consuming.
- To enable distributing the test cases as a single, small generator file. No need to send 20 MB of `testcases.zip` over email anymore.
- During problem development, constraints often change. Using a generator, we can easily amend the constraints and rerun the generator when needed.

**Why do we need a framework for that?**

- Not everyone knows how to write a good test cases generator.
- To avoid writing repetitive and boring tasks. For example: creating test case files with correct suffixes (`foo_1.in`, `foo_1.out`), running the official solution against the test case input files, etc.
- To have a consistent format for generators, so that problem writers in a contest can better collaborate in writing test case generators.

## Credits

**tcframe** is based on a paper submitted to IOI conference in 2015: [Introducing tcframe: A Simple and Robust Test Cases Generation Framework](https://ioinformatics.org/journal/v9_2015_57_73.pdf), written by **Ashar Fuadi**.
